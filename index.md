## About
This library is featuring linear algebra solvers for the solution of spatially and temporally discretized mechanics problems. In its core, it serves as a binding between the [LinearAlgebra](https://github.com/mgroupntua/linearalgebra) and the [MSolve.Core](https://github.com/mgroupntua/MSolve.Core) repos.
