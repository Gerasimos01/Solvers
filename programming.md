### About
Here you can find information about how to use this library in small scale scenarios. The purpose of this library is to create the linear system matrix in an appropriate storage format from the physical model and then solve the linear system. This is achieved by employing linear algebra operations, provided by the [LinearAlgebra](https://github.com/mgroupntua/LinearAlgebra) library, possibly in conjuction with advanced techniques, such as Domain Decomposotion Methods.
